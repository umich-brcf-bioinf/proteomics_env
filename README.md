## About 
This environment is built on the bioconductor_docker image.  It contains packages used for statistical analysis of proteomics data (limma, qvalue) as well as protein subcellular localization data (MSNbase, pRoloc and pRolocData).  
This environment is provided as a Docker image on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/umichbfxcore/proteomics_env), and this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/umich-brcf-bioinf/proteomics_env). A containerized environment provides each user with the same software and setup, ensuring reproducibility across users and over time.
