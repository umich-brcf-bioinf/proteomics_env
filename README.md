## About 
This environment is built on the bioconductor_docker image.  It contains packages used for statistical analysis of proteomics data (limma, qvalue) as well as protein subcellular localization data (MSNbase, pRoloc and pRolocData).  
This environment is provided as a Docker image on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/umichbfxcore/proteomics_env), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/umich-brcf-bioinf/proteomics_env). A containerized environment provides each user with the same software and setup, ensuring reproducibility across users and over time.

Tags on both Dockerhub and Github are set to match the BFXcore Job ID.
